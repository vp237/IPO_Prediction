# Project Proposal:
### 1. Problem Statement:
An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the first sale of stocks issued by a company to the public. IPO stocks can be very volatile in the days immediately after an IPO. We will be considering the following criteria to evaluate the success of an IPO: the IPO stock is not overpriced at issuance, or in other words, yields an increase in the stock price for the first day; the volume of interest compared to companies in the same industry/sector. This project will be worthwhile owing to the previously mentioned importance of IPOs and the value that such a project could unlock. We believe that we will succeed owing to us possessing a sufficient amount of applicable data and identifiable features that would allow us to explore practical and viable solutions.
For this project, we are looking to answer the following question: What is the most reliable predictor that can be used to predict the success of an IPO? Potential predictors include industries/sectors, locations, the number of years the company had been operating before going IPO, which day of the week the stock went public on.
 
### 2. Dataset Description:
The link to the data set:<br/> 
       [Stocks IPO Information and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/proselotis/financial-ipo-data)<br/>  
       
The dataset we collected is from Kaggle, which is called Stocks IPO Information and Results. The dataset contains data for 3762 different stock tickers, with parameters including:<br/>

  (1) The date the company went public <br/>
  (2) Price data since the IPO, including: <br/>
     - Opening price of each day from day 1 - day 261 <br/>
     - Closing price of each day from day 1 - day 261 <br/>
     - Volume of each day from day 1 - day 261 <br/>
     - The number of days the stock outperformed the S&P 500 <br/>
  (3) Each company’s financials and operations pre-IPO, including: <br/>
     - Net income of the company 1 year after the IPO <br/>
     - The industry/sector the company is in <br/>
     - The number of company’ employees <br/>
     - The location of the company’ headquarters <br/>
     - The year the company was founded <br/>
Our data is composed of a variety of factors, elements, and aspects that will give us a holistic and wide ranging perspective on what warrants the success of the IPO. This along with the volume and number of cases will help produce visible trends and pinpoint outliers. Through the use of this vast data set, we will be able to source and find the major and minor components and ingredients of a successful IPO. <br/>

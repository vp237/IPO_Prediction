An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the first sale of stocks issued by a company to the public. IPO stocks can be very volatile in the days immediately after an IPO. We will be considering the following criteria to evaluate the success of an IPO: the IPO stock is overpriced/underpriced at issuance, or in other words, yields an increase/decrease in the stock price for the first day; offer-to-current return (cumulative return captured in the growth from the initial IPO price to the current market price); number of days the stock performs better than the S&P 500. For this project, we are looking to answer the following question:

What are the most reliable and effective predictors that can be used to predict the success of an IPO? Potential predictors include industries/sectors, locations, the number of years the company had been operating before going IPO, which day of the week the stock went public on.

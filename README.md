An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the first sale of stocks issued by a company to the public. IPO stocks can be very volatile in the days immediately after an IPO. We will be considering the following criteria to evaluate the success of an IPO: the IPO stock is overpriced/underpriced at issuance, or in other words, yields an increase/decrease in the stock price for the first day. For this project, we are looking to answer the following question:

What are the best models that can be used to predict the success of an IPO? Predictors include industries/sectors, locations, the number of years the company had been operating before going IPO, which day of the week the stock went public on.
